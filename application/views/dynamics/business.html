<p><span class="txt_hlt">At Samaras One</span> we choose to have a non passive approach to a small number of high quality businesses rather than the “more traditional model” to produce many listings in the hope some might sell. </p><br />
<p><span class="txt_hlt">Our belief</span> that through networking with domestic and international investors and using alternative sources of advertising our potential market outreach is maximised, allowing us to gain greater results than our competitors.</p><br />
<p><span class="txt_hlt">Our ability</span> to find businesses that may not necessarily be aware of the potential of selling, and bringing them forward to you, without creating an unrealistic price expectation, is the key to having a successful acquisition approach - and the model we believe in. </p><br />
<p><span class="txt_hlt">The solution</span> we believe in is Target Marketing, ensuring to match the right people to the right business.  Whether buying or selling a business, we will be with you every step of the way. </p>
